This is a simple version of Yahtzee built in React thanks to the course of Colt Steele in Udemy.

Each round, the player rolls five 6-sided dice. He can click on any number of dice in order to display it or not. They may re-roll the unfrozen dice up to 2 times. After that, the player has to asign the result to any unclaimed scoring category, scroring differently.

When the game is over (after 13 rounds) is possilbe to see the playerâ€™s score total from all the scoring categories.
